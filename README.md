# reactjs-docs-tictactoe-tutorial

This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game built following the official React tutorial. While the React documentation's tutorial is written for JavaScript, I've adapted and implemented it using TypeScript. The purpose of this repository is to provide a hands-on learning experience based on the React tutorial available in the React documentation, while incorporating TypeScript for type-safe development.

## Tutorial Source

The tutorial followed for creating this Tic-Tac-Toe game can be found in the official React documentation. The tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on building a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using React concepts. Although the original tutorial is oriented towards JavaScript, I've taken the liberty to translate and apply its principles using TypeScript, offering a practical example of using React with a statically typed language.

## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their own marks.
